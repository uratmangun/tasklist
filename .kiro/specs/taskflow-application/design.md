# TaskFlow Application Design

## Architecture Overview
TaskFlow is built as a modern React single-page application using TypeScript, integrating Clerk for authentication, shadcn/ui for component library, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation between authenticated and unauthenticated states.

## Technical Approach
The application leverages React hooks for state management, Clerk's authentication components for user access control, and a responsive design pattern using Tailwind CSS. The design emphasizes modern UI/UX principles with card-based layouts, smooth transitions, and intuitive interaction patterns.

## Component Design

### HomePage Component
- **Purpose**: Main application entry point that handles authentication state routing
- **Dependencies**: Clerk authentication hooks, UI components, Lucide React icons
- **Interface**: Renders either SignedOut welcome screen or SignedIn task management interface
- **State Management**: Uses React useState for tasks, filters, and form inputs

### Authentication Flow Components
- **SignedOut Component**: Welcome screen with TaskFlow branding and sign-in call-to-action
- **SignedIn Component**: Full task management interface with header, main content, and sidebar
- **User Profile Integration**: Displays user avatar and name from Clerk user data

### Task Management Components
- **Task Creation Form**: Input field with priority selector and add button
- **Task List Display**: Filterable list with checkboxes, delete buttons, and priority indicators  
- **Task Filtering System**: Tab-based navigation for All/Active/Completed views
- **Statistics Sidebar**: Real-time metrics with badges and progress visualization

### UI Component Library
- **Card Components**: CardHeader, CardContent, CardTitle for structured layouts
- **Form Components**: Input fields, buttons, and select dropdowns
- **Data Display**: Badges, separators, progress bars, and avatars
- **Navigation**: Tabs system for filtering and state management

## Data Flow

### Task State Management
1. Initial task data loaded as mock data with id, title, completed status, creation date, and priority
2. User interactions (add, toggle, delete) trigger state updates via React useState
3. Filter changes update the displayed task list through computed filteredTasks array
4. Statistics automatically recalculate based on current task state

### Authentication Flow
1. App initialization checks Clerk authentication status
2. Unauthenticated users see welcome screen with sign-in modal
3. Successful authentication triggers re-render to signed-in interface
4. User profile data populates header avatar and display name
5. Sign-out action returns user to welcome screen

### Priority System
1. Task creation allows priority selection (low/medium/high)
2. Priority stored with task data and displayed via colored indicators
3. Priority legend in sidebar explains color coding system
4. Priority information persists across all filtering operations

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimizations
- React functional components with hooks for efficient re-rendering
- Computed derived state for filtered tasks and statistics
- Tailwind CSS for optimized styling without runtime CSS-in-JS overhead
- Lazy loading potential for large task lists (future enhancement)

### Security Implementation
- Clerk handles all authentication security including OAuth, session management
- Client-side authentication state management through Clerk React hooks
- No sensitive data stored in local state, relies on Clerk's secure session handling
- Environment variables for Clerk configuration keys

### Accessibility Standards
- Semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- ARIA labels and roles for screen reader compatibility
- High contrast ratios and focus indicators for visual accessibility

### Responsive Design Strategy
- Mobile-first Tailwind CSS approach with responsive breakpoints
- Flexible grid layout that adapts from single-column mobile to two-column desktop
- Touch-friendly button sizes and spacing for mobile interactions
- Optimized typography scaling across device sizes

### Scalability Considerations
- Component architecture designed for easy extension and modification
- State management pattern ready for upgrade to Redux/Zustand for complex applications
- API integration points prepared for backend task persistence
- Modular UI component structure allows for design system expansion
