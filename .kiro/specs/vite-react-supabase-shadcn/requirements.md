# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a modern full-stack web application using Vite as the build tool, React for the frontend framework, Supabase for backend services (database), and shadcn/ui for the component library. The project will provide a solid foundation for building scalable web applications with modern tooling and best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly configured Vite + React project setup, so that I can build modern web applications with fast development experience and optimized production builds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a Vite project with React and TypeScript configuration
2. WHEN the development server is started THEN the system SHALL provide hot module replacement and fast refresh
3. WHEN the project is built for production THEN the system SHALL generate optimized, minified assets
4. WHEN ESLint and Prettier are configured THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent code formatting and quality standards

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Supabase integration configured, so that I can use database features in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Supabase client is initialized THEN the system SHALL connect to the Supabase project using environment variables
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL provide type-safe database queries and mutations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shadcn/ui components integrated, so that I can build consistent and accessible user interfaces quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN shadcn/ui is initialized THEN the system SHALL configure Tailwind CSS and component dependencies
2. WHEN components are imported THEN the system SHALL provide pre-built, customizable UI components
3. WHEN the design system is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling across the application
4. WHEN accessibility features are used THEN the system SHALL ensure components meet WCAG guidelines

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper project structure and configuration, so that I can maintain and scale the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project structure is created THEN the system SHALL organize files into logical directories (components, pages, hooks, utils, types)
2. WHEN TypeScript is configured THEN the system SHALL provide type safety and IntelliSense support
3. WHEN environment variables are set up THEN the system SHALL securely manage configuration for different environments
4. WHEN package management is configured THEN the system SHALL use bun or pnpm for dependency management

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want routing and state management configured, so that I can build multi-page applications with proper data flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React Router is configured THEN the system SHALL support client-side routing
2. WHEN state management is implemented THEN the system SHALL handle global application state efficiently
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain proper URL structure and browser history

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want development and build scripts configured, so that I can efficiently develop, test, and deploy the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN development scripts are run THEN the system SHALL start the dev server with proper environment configuration
2. WHEN build scripts are executed THEN the system SHALL generate production-ready assets
3. WHEN linting is performed THEN the system SHALL check code quality and formatting
4. WHEN type checking is run THEN the system SHALL validate TypeScript types across the project
